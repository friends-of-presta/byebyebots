# Bye bye bots

A simple module to make PrestaShop stop to log in the database the visits of the bots.

This may make your statistics more "accurate".

Based on the pull request of Jean Fran√ßois Viguier, see here [his contribution](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/17322) to the core.

## Why a module if it's contributed to the Core ?

His contribution won't be available until 1.7.8, this module is available for every version from 1.6.0 to 1.7.7.

Having a Community module is an efficient solution while staying resilient to the Core team decisions to get extra features/fixes.

## I want to contribute !

If you find a bug, you'd better contribute it to the Core first and then come back with the link of the pull request.

If you want to help "Friends of Presta", you are very welcome ! Don't hesitate to come our the Slack user group.
